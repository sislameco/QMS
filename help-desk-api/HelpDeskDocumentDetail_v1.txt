Overview
We need to development a quality management system (QMS) that is a standalone platform that is a SAAS and plugged in to our different companies. 
Each of our companies has its own ERP and will need bespoke integration.
The quality management system will consist of the following: 
- Helpdesk. User support via tickets submitted on ERP frontend that are sent to the ticket centre and department ticket list in ERP back office.
- Customer Complaints. Able to create customer complaint items and these are listed within quality and customer care dashboard in ERP back office.
- CAPA. Located in quality dashboard in ERP back office, Quality manager can create CAPA items or frontend users can create support tickets for CAPA and also existing tickets can be escalated to CAPA.
- Risk Register. Located in quality menu in ERP back office. Quality manager can create risk items and link to helpdesk tickets, customer complaints, CAPA items or Goals
- Goals: Located in quality menu in ERP back office. Quality manager can create Goal items and link to helpdesk tickets, customer complaints, CAPA items or Risk items. Goals are also mapped to departments.
